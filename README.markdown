<center>PrisonSuite</center>
================

PrisonSuite is the central dependency for several plugins that are made to perform various tasks on prison-style role-playing Minecraft servers.

By itself, PrisonSuite does very little, instead, it handles all the region selection, timed tasks, general settings, and language files for its subplugins.
Please, refer to the [wiki page](https://github.com/bitWolfy/PrisonSuite/wiki) for [command](https://github.com/bitWolfy/PrisonSuite/wiki/Commands) and [permission](https://github.com/bitWolfy/PrisonSuite/wiki/Permissions) information.

Optional dependencies
------------------
* **WorldEdit** - The plugin can use WorldEdit region selection and transformation instead of the built-in tools. Unlike PrisonSuite, WorldEdit is a tool that was made to handle selections and therefore does its job much better then this plugin ever will.
* **Vault** - A great plugin that introduces a variety of economy, chat, and permission hooks to Bukkit servers. This plugin is used by PrisonSuite to handle any economical interactions between players and plugin elements, such as signs.
