<center>PrisonSuite</center>
================

PrisonSuite is the central dependency for several plugins that are made to perform various tasks on prison-style roleplaying Minecraft servers.

By itself, PrisonSuite does very little, instead, it handles all the region selection, timed tasks, general settings, and language files for its subplugins.
Please, refer to the wiki page for command and permission information.

Optional dependency
------------------
* **WorldEdit** - The plugin can use WorldEdit region selection and transformation instead of the built-in tools. Unlike PrisonSuite, WorldEdit is a tool that was made to handle selections and therefore does its job much better then this plugin ever will.
